# Comparative-Analysis-of-NB-and-ID3

## Introduction
As credit card becomes the most general mode of payment (both online and regular purchase), fraud rate tends to accelerate. In later years, credit card fraud has grown to a serious and threatening financial crime. This crime involves counterfeit or hijack of one or several legitimate attributes of the user, by means of identity theft, physical theft of cards, hacking of online user credentials etc, and using such illegitimate information for own advantages. Data mining is one of the effective methods of controlling credit card fraud. Detecting fraudulent transactions using traditional methods of manual detection are time consuming and inaccurate, thus the advent of machne learning had made these manual methods more impractical

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to give in detail comparison based on certain performance metrics between Naive Bayes and ID3 algorithms.
Other objectives include:
- To study a better Supervised learning algorithm
- To extract relevant features
- To hyper-tune the model eventually, helping in better predictions

## Naive Bayes
Naïve Bayes is a statistical approach based on Bayesian Theory, which chooses the decision based on highest probability. Bayesian probability estimates unknown probabilities from known values. It also allows prior knowledge and logic to be applied to uncertain statements. This technique has an assumption of conditional independence among features in the data. The Naïve Bayes classifier is based on the conditional probabilities.asdadadasdadad
